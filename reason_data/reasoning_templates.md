## Log Anomaly Detection

### üß† Conceptional Thinking Templates

**Step 1:** Mark it normal when values (such as memory address, floating number and register value) in a log are invalid.<br>
**Step 2:** Mark it normal when there is a lack of information.<br>
**Step 3:** Never consider ‚ü®*‚ü© and missing values as abnormal patterns.<br>
**Step 4:** Mark it abnormal when and only when the alert is explicitly expressed in textual content (such as keywords like error or interrupt).<br>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Procedural Thinking Templates for BGL

**Step 1:** Check diagnostics such as register dumps, counters, configuration reports, health metrics, and service banners, which are routine and normal.<br>
**Step 2:** Review fault-tolerance signals like correctable errors, link retries, transient exceptions, and management tool messages, which are normal if recovery occurs.<br>
**Step 3:** Watch for kernel crashes, assertion failures, or abnormal exits of core processes, which indicate unrecoverable software or runtime errors that cause abnormal behavior.<br>
**Step 4:** Examine power modules, machine check interrupts, network or interconnect losses, and storage mount failures, which may signal hardware defects or service disruption that cause abnormal behavior.<br>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Procedural Thinking Templates for Spirit

**Step 1:** Check system initialization and hardware configuration outputs (CPU registers, APIC/LAPIC, RAID/partition checks, BIOS/PCI corrections, memory maps) which are routine during boot or reconfiguration.<br>
**Step 2:** Review service and driver messages (Postfix retries, daemons, device drivers, HP agents, RAID detection, logging daemons) which are expected and normal unless critical errors appear.<br>
**Step 3:** Observe fault-tolerance related outputs (checkpoint warnings, NFS mount permission errors, deferred mail, login/authentication retries, memory allocation warnings) which may indicate recoverable issues if the system continues to run.<br>
**Step 4:** Watch for unrecoverable conditions (NFS failures, disk/controller errors like drive not ready, failed epilog jobs, assertion failures, repeated root authentication failures) which indicate abnormal behavior requiring attention.<br>
**Step 5:** Examine hardware or network faults (machine check errors, LANai not running, node bailout failures, repeated protocol errors) which suggest hardware defects, instability, or service disruption causing abnormal behavior.<br>

## Log Interpretation

### üß† Conceptional Thinking Templates

**Step 1:** Contextualize the log entry by considering the system environment, application type, and operational context to understand the broader scenario.<br>
**Step 2:** Identify the error type and its general implications using domain knowledge and common patterns in software behavior.<br>
**Step 3:** Relate the error to specific system components, configurations, or code paths that could generate such an entry, leveraging mental models of how errors propagate.<br>
**Step 4:** Synthesize an interpretation that explains the error's significance, ensuring it aligns with the observed log data and avoids assumptions without evidence.<br>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Procedural Thinking Templates

**Step 1:** Extract the exact error message, code, or keyword from the log (e.g., "500 Internal Server Error").<br>
**Step 2:** Classify the error based on category (e.g., server-side, client-side, network) using predefined taxonomies or experience.<br>
**Step 3:** Recall standard documentation, common causes, or known issues associated with the error (e.g., PHP configuration directives like display_errors).<br>
**Step 4:** Examine additional log details such as timestamps, severity levels, stack traces, or environment variables for contextual clues.<br>
**Step 5:** Formulate a concise interpretation by combining the error message with contextual information, ensuring it addresses the user's query directly.<br>

## Root Cause Analysis

### üß† Conceptional Thinking Templates

**Step 1:** Isolate the key event or error from the log that represents the symptom of the problem, focusing on its uniqueness and impact.<br>
**Step 2:** Generate multiple hypotheses for potential root causes by considering system dependencies, recent changes, and failure modes from past incidents.<br>
**Step 3:** Validate each hypothesis against log evidence, such as error sequences, frequency, or correlations, using deductive reasoning.<br>
**Step 4:** Converge on the most plausible root cause by applying principles like Occam's razor or prioritizing causes with the highest explanatory power.<br>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Procedural Thinking Templates

**Step 1:** Identify the primary error or failure point in the log, noting any repeated patterns or anomalies.<br>
**Step 2:** Trace backward in the log to find preceding events that might have triggered the error (e.g., configuration updates, resource usage spikes, dependency failures).<br>
**Step 3:** Check for common root causes such as software bugs, misconfigurations, hardware issues, or version incompatibilities, based on industry best practices.<br>
**Step 4:** Analyze specific error details for clues (e.g., PHP version changes, directive settings like error_reporting), and cross-reference with known documentation.<br>
**Step 5:** Confirm the root cause by matching log evidence with known issues, ensuring it fully explains the observed behavior without contradictions.<br>

### üìñ Templates from Manual

**Step 1:** Recognize the problem by distinguishing the triggering event from the real underlying issue.<br>
**Step 2:** Evaluate the significance of the problem by evaluating severity, likelihood, and recurrence and whether it reflects systemic or cultural deficiencies.<br>
**Step 3:** Determine the immediate causes (conditions or actions) that directly led to the problem.<br>
**Step 4:** Investigate the reasons why the causes in the preceding identification step existed, working your way back to the root cause.<br>

## Solution Recommendation

### üß† Conceptional Thinking Templates

**Step 1:** Derive potential solutions from the identified root cause, considering both immediate fixes and long-term improvements.<br>
**Step 2:** Evaluate each solution's feasibility, risk, and impact on the system, prioritizing those that are minimal, tested, and sustainable.<br>
**Step 3:** Select the most appropriate solution based on cost-benefit analysis, alignment with system constraints, and organizational policies.<br>
**Step 4:** Provide a recommendation with clear references to official sources, community wisdom, or best practices to ensure credibility.<br>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Procedural Thinking Templates

**Step 1:** Review the root cause analysis to determine the exact action required (e.g., change configuration, apply patch, update software).<br>
**Step 2:** Search for official documentation, release notes, or community forums for verified solutions (e.g., PHP manual for display_errors setting).<br>
**Step 3:** Specify the solution steps precisely (e.g., "Set display_errors to On in php.ini" or "Update PHP to a newer version").<br>
**Step 4:** Include references to specific resources (e.g., PHP changelog for version 5.2.4) to provide evidence and context.<br>

### üìñ Templates from Manual

**Step 1:** Identify the corrective action for each cause.<br>
**Step 2:** Assess whether the corrective actions can prevent recurrence.<br>
**Step 3:** Determine whether the corrective actions are feasible.<br>
**Step 4:** Verify whether the corrective actions allow meeting primary objectives or mission.<br>
**Step 5:** Examine whether the corrective actions avoid introducing new risks, with any assumed risks clearly stated and without degrading the safety of other systems.<br>
**Step 6:** Review whether the immediate actions taken were appropriate and effective.<br>
