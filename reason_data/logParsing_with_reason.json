This is a block identifier with both fixed (\"blk_\") and variable parts (the numeric ID).

Next, I focus on any specific patterns or tokens. The \"blk_-2094397855762091248\" part is a block identifier, which can be represented as a variable. I'll replace the specific number with a placeholder for a variable, represented as <*>. The number 67108864 is likely a size value, and since it can change, it should also be replaced with a generic variable placeholder, <*>. Then, I have the IP address \"/10.251.126.83\", which can also be a variable that represents an IP address, so I'll replace it with another variable placeholder /<*>. The final result will be a template that generalizes the structure of this log.</think><answer>Received block blk_<*> of size <*> from /<*></answer>"

    "reasoning": "<think>First, I need to examine the log carefully and identify any parts that can be replaced with variables based on the reasoning guidance provided. The first step is to check if there are any double spaces, but in this case, there is only a single space between tokens. So no action is required for double spaces.\n\nNext, I will check if any part of the log contains digit tokens that should be replaced with variables. The tokens \"uid=0\" and \"euid=0\" contain digits, so I should replace the digits (0) with a variable. The digit \"0\" after \"uid=\" and \"euid=\" should be replaced with {{variable}}.\n\nI then look at whether \"True\" or \"False\" appear in the log, but there are no such values here, so I don't need to replace anything for that.\n\nThe next task is to identify if there are any path-like tokens that should be replaced with a variable. There aren't any path-like elements in this log, so no changes are needed here.\n\nNext, I see that \"rhost=218.188.2.4\" contains a specific IP address. According to the reasoning guidance, any specific values like this should be replaced with \"<*>\", since \"rhost\" contains an IP address, which is a type of variable information.\n\nThe rest of the log appears to be a fixed string, so no further substitutions are needed.\n\nFinally, after all these replacements, I now have the final log template where \"rhost\" has been replaced by <*> and the digits in \"uid\" and \"euid\" are left as they are because they are not part of a general pattern. The result should be the log template format reflecting this.</think><answer>authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*></answer>"

    "reasoning": "<think>Alright, I start by carefully reading the original log:  \n`authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=217.60.212.66  user=guest`.\n\nStep 1: The Reasoning Guidance says to replace sequences of numbers with `<*>`. But here, \"uid=0\" and \"euid=0\" are numbers. However, I need to check carefully if the template keeps those zeros literal or replaces them. Looking at the rules, step 7 says specifically: \"Replace any 'uid=' and 'euid=' with 'uid=<*>' and 'euid=<*>' respectively.\" That means these should become `uid=<*>` and `euid=<*>`. But the given template keeps them as `uid=0 euid=0`. So I must align with the actual template. That means, although the guideline exists, the final template retains `uid=0` and `euid=0`. So no substitution there.\n\nStep 2: Now check IP addresses. The part `rhost=217.60.212.66` clearly contains an IP address. Rule 2 says replace IP addresses with `<*>`. That matches with the template’s replacement.\n\nStep 3: Check host names — not present.  \nStep 4: \"size \" not in this log.  \nStep 5: \"blk_\" not present.  \nStep 6: \"user=\" exists at the end with \"guest\". Rule says replace sequences indicating a user with `user=<*>`. But in the template, it remains `user=guest`. So in this case, it stays literal.  \nStep 7: Already checked `uid=` and `euid=`, and the template keeps them as-is.  \nStep 8: Keep the structure and text for logs that have no variable parts — yes, so everything else like \"authentication failure;\" stays the same.  \nStep 9: Time indicators — none.  \nStep 10: Numbers in event or action — not applicable.  \nStep 11: Connection/disconnection — not applicable here.\n\nSo, the only replacement applied is rule 2: the IP address `217.60.212.66` → `<*>`.\n\nThus the final template is exactly:  \n`authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*>  user=guest`.</think><answer>authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*>  user=guest</answer>"

Here, I see \"5070\", \"1166\", and \"363\", and also \"<1 sec>\". These are numbers, so I will replace them with placeholders.  \nStep 3: There are no True/False values, so skip.  \nStep 4: Replace path-like tokens with variables. The \"proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070\" is a hostname with a port, so it's a variable.  \nStep 5: Tokens with fixed and variable parts: \"1.13 KB\" inside parentheses is mixed content, so it should be absorbed into the variable segment around it.  \nStep 6: Consecutive variables should merge: after replacing numeric and mixed tokens, some adjacent values will collapse into one placeholder. For example, \"1166 bytes (1.13 KB)\" becomes one variable block.  \nStep 7: Dot-separated tokens treated as one variable: \"proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk\" fits here, so it's part of the first placeholder.  \n\nFollowing these transformations, I see the structure:  \n- Start with one variable for the hostname and port.  \n- Then fixed text \"close,\".  \n- Then a variable for the \"1166 bytes (1.13 KB)\" segment.  \n- Then fixed \"sent,\".  \n- Then another variable for \"363 bytes\".  \n- Then fixed \"received, lifetime\".  \n- Finally, a variable for \"<1 sec>\".  \n\nThis matches the provided pattern: `<*> close, <*> bytes <*> sent, <*> bytes <*> received, lifetime <*>`.</think><answer><*> close, <*> bytes <*> sent, <*> bytes <*> received, lifetime <*></answer>"
